- project: Built-In-Test System Architecture
  role: Primary Engineer
  duration: May &mdash; August 2019
  # url: "#"
  description: This project was done as part of my 2019 Systems Engineering Internship. I designed a system architecture retroactively for a new built-in-testing system on an unmanned aircraft. This included requirements on which sensors are addressed to test nominal performance, how the BIT data is used by the system, and how the BIT data is displayed to the user.

- project: Flight Data Analysis to analyze component faults
  role: Primary developer
  duration: June &mdash; August 2020
  # url: "#"
  description: This project was done in MatLab as part of my Systems Engineering Internship in the Summer of 2020. The goal was to analyze the telemetry data of an aircraft, and turn discrete status updates into continuous time-based depictions of failure time. The program would also analyze how many times each component failed and for how long, while also taking into account sensors that fail pre/post launch.

- project: Multithreaded HTTP Server with fault tolerance via Redundancy
  role: Primary Developer
  duration: December 2020

  description: This was done as a school project in C/C++, in the class Principles of Computer System Design

- project: Program to generate topic-based sentences in person-specific grammar
  role: Co-developer
  duration: January 2020
  url: "https://github.com/Garrett-Webb/trumptweets"
  description: This was a project that I made for CruzHacks 2020 with a partner. The program cleans and processes twitter data from former president Donald Trump, and uses an n-gram model and Azure sentiment analysis to generate a new tweet based on a given topic.
