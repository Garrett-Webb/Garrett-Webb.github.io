  description: I have held many leadership postions including Senior Patrol Leader in my boy scout troop where I was in charge of running the meetings with 50+ scouts and their parents, as well as being in charge of planning outings. I served as the Vice President of the Enthusiastic Programmers club at Moorpark College, where we organized outings as a club to Hackathons including but not limited to CruzHacks 2020l, HackHarvard 2018, and SFHacks 2017. I also organized a voluntary casual tutoring session for any Computer Science student to get help when they needed and socialize at the same time.
